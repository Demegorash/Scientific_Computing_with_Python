The Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) curriculum will equip you with the skills to analyze and manipulate data using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. You'll learn key concepts like data structures, algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and how to perform complex calculations using a variety of tools.

This comprehensive course will guide you through the fundamentals of scientific computing, including data structures, and algorithms.

It has multiple courses on it, I will broke it in lessons you will be able to find on the different sections for this repository.

Please be advised, I am leaning and this is just for learning Python.

Hope you can find it interesting and do not forget to follow me on my socials so I will be creating content soon.

Happy leaning!!!
